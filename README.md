# Pathfinding Visualizer

A simple and interactive **Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer** built using **Python and Pygame**. This project allows you to visualize popular pathfinding algorithms like **DFS, BFS, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and A\*** in real-time on a customizable grid. It also includes features like a home screen, algorithm selection, and a reset option.

## Features

- Home Screen Interface with algorithm selection
- Supports the following algorithms:
  - Dijkstra's Algorithm
  - A* Search Algorithm
  - Depth First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth First Search (BFS)

- Visual differentiation of different searching algorithms
- Reset button ('R') to return to the home screen
- Real-time grid updates
- Intuitive and simple user interface
